# Simple Regression Model Tutorial

This repository provides a simple and beginner-friendly tutorial on creating a regression model using Python, TensorFlow, and other popular libraries. The model predicts outputs based on a small dataset and visualizes the results through scatter plots.

## Features
- Load and visualize dataset.
- Build and train a TensorFlow regression model.
- Evaluate model performance using Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
- Visualize predictions alongside training and testing data.

## Libraries Used
The project uses the following Python libraries:
- `pandas`: For data manipulation.
- `numpy`: For numerical operations.
- `matplotlib`: For data visualization.
- `tensorflow`: For building and training the regression model.
- `scikit-learn`: For splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.

## Installation
Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ainexus1/Simple-Regression-Model-Tutorial-For-Beginners.git

2. Install Dependencies
Make sure you have Python installed (3.7 or above). Install the required libraries using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow

 ## Output
- Scatter plots for data visualization and predictions.
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE) printed on the console.
- The trained model's performance on the test dataset.
